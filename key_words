subject/let

Subject blocks allow you to control the initialization of the subject under test. If you don’t have any custom initialization required, then you’re given a default subject method already. All it does is call new on the class you’re testing.
let

Let blocks allow you to provide some input to the subject block that change in various contexts. This way you can simply provide an alternative let block for a given value and not have to duplicate the setup code for the subject over again. Let blocks also work inside of before :each blocks if you need them.

Let and let!
Use let to define a memoized helper method. 
The value will be cached across multiple calls 
in the same example but not across examples.

Note that let is lazy-evaluated: 
it is not evaluated until the first time
the method it defines is invoked. 
You can use let! to force the method's
invocation before each example.
